SmartDocs Project
Overview
SmartDocs is a web-based application designed to streamline document management by leveraging advanced AI models for document classification, information extraction, and document visual question answering (DocVQA). The project allows users to upload, classify, extract information from, and query documents dynamically, with a user-friendly dashboard to visualize and manage document data.
Features

Document Upload and Management: Upload documents and organize them into categories like Licenses, Passports, Invoices, Checks, Resumes, and more.
Document Classification: Automatically classify documents into predefined categories using the LayoutLM model.
Information Extraction: Extract key information (e.g., titles, dates, amounts) from documents using the Donut model.
Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA): Ask questions about document content, with answers generated by the Donut model.
Interactive Dashboard: View documents in grid and table formats, delete or edit documents, and manage shared documents.
User Settings: Options to change password, update profile, and toggle notifications.

Models Used
LayoutLM for Document Classification
SmartDocs uses LayoutLM, a multimodal model developed by Microsoft, to classify documents into categories such as Licenses, Passports, Invoices, Checks, Resumes, and Shared Documents. LayoutLM combines text and layout information from document images to achieve high accuracy in classification tasks. It leverages the following:

Text and Layout Understanding: Incorporates both textual content and the spatial arrangement of text on the page, making it ideal for documents with complex layouts.
Pre-training: LayoutLM is pre-trained on large datasets like RVL-CDIP, which contains 400,000 document images across 16 classes, achieving up to 94.42% accuracy in document image classification.
Implementation in SmartDocs: The model processes uploaded documents to determine their category, enabling automatic organization in the dashboard (e.g., placing a license document in the "License" section).

Donut for Information Extraction and Document Visual Question Answering
SmartDocs employs the Donut (Document Understanding Transformer) model for both information extraction and DocVQA tasks. Donut, developed by NAVER CLOVA, is an OCR-free, end-to-end Transformer model that processes document images directly, eliminating the need for separate OCR engines. Key aspects include:

Information Extraction:
Donut extracts structured data (e.g., titles, file sizes, dates) from documents by converting document images into text sequences, which are then parsed into JSON-like formats.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets like CORD (receipt understanding), outperforming models like LayoutLM in terms of speed and accuracy due to its OCR-free approach.
In SmartDocs, Donut extracts metadata from uploaded documents, populating fields in the dashboard's document table (e.g., file size, uploaded date).


Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA):
Donut enables users to ask questions about document content (e.g., "What is the invoice amount?"), processing the document image and question to provide accurate answers.
It uses a single Transformer-based architecture to handle both visual and textual data, achieving competitive results on the DocVQA benchmark with an ANLS score comparable to LayoutLMv3 (83.37).
In SmartDocs, this feature is planned for future integration, allowing users to query document content directly from the dashboard.


Advantages of Donut:
Processes high-resolution images without downscaling, preserving document details.
Reduces computational overhead by skipping OCR, making it faster and less error-prone.
Versatile for multiple tasks, including classification, parsing, and question answering.



Installation

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartdocs.git
cd smartdocs


Set Up a Virtual Environment:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up the Models:
Download pre-trained LayoutLM and Donut models from Hugging Face:pip install transformers


Load the models in your application (refer to models/ directory for scripts).


Run the Application:python manage.py runserver

Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8000.

Usage

Log In: Use your credentials to access the SmartDocs dashboard.
Upload a Document:
Click the "Upload Document" button in the header.
Select a file and submit. The document will be classified using LayoutLM and its metadata extracted using Donut.


View Documents:
Documents are displayed in the respective sections (e.g., Licenses, Invoices) in both grid and table views.
Click a document to view its details or edit/delete it.


Future Feature - Ask Questions:
Once DocVQA is integrated, youâ€™ll be able to ask questions about documents (e.g., "What is the total amount on this invoice?") directly from the interface.
